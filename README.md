# Snake Game
This simple Snake Game is implemented in Python using the Pygame library. It's a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake, guiding it to eat apples and grow longer. The game continues until the snake collides with itself.

## Features

- **Snake Movement:** Use arrow keys (or WASD) to navigate the snake: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
- **Scoring:** Each time the snake eats an apple, the player's score increases.
- **Game Over:** The game ends if the snake collides with the game boundaries or itself.
